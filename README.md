# SwiftCoreDataFromScratch

This file is a TableView template based on the SWIFT CORE DATA FROM SCRATCH tutorials from http://theapplady.net These tutorials are arranged into 5 workshops preceded by an introductory file w/the base project. Workshops are organized as follows:

http://theapplady.net/swift-core-data-from-scratch-introduction/
http://theapplady.net/swift-core-data-from-scratch-workshop-1/
http://theapplady.net/swift-core-data-from-scratch-workshop-2/
http://theapplady.net/swift-core-data-from-scratch-workshop-3/
http://theapplady.net/swift-core-data-from-scratch-workshop-4/
http://theapplady.net/swift-core-data-from-scratch-workshop-5/

I started using these tutorials as a means of exploring TableView features. Once I have this basic version, I'm going to add UILocalizedIndexedCollation to organize the table alphabetically.

After I get this initial TableView project working, then it will be time to replicate this project into my actual project. The second project will entail adding a custom keyboard and it will use an API that Apple hasn't released yet.
